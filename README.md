## The problem

To make an OMLET you need to crack some data. We propose to make machine learning models that have been trained on shipboard data to explore the data around OOI installations Station Papa, Coastal Pioneer, and Coastal Endurance. We will be start with the following parameters:
* Temperature
* Salinity
* Dissolved Oxygen
* Chlorophyll

In order to eggsecute the hack we will use different toolkits, such as:
* Keras
* SciKit-Learn

## Application Example

We want to take shipboard data, such as a (sub)set of Line P data for Station Papa, and train the network to recognize good data vs anomalous data. Anomalous data can represent a problem with the sensor to an interesting phenomena different from the norm.

## Specific Tasks

1. Create a simple format for data to be fed into the model
2. Build ML models
3. Testing to see models work
4. Cross-validation

## Existing methods

Linear regression(s)

## Proposed methods/tools

Machine learning
